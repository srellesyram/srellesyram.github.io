Here I am with pits and pouts
Thanks for sitting out my doubts
You’ve seen all my spits and spouts
Thanks for sitting out my doubts
Heard me hoot and heard me howl
Thanks for sitting out my doubts
Seen me snarl and seen me growl
Thanks for sitting out my doubts

All alone or in some crowd
Thanks for sitting out my doubts
Often quiet, sometimes loud
Thanks for sitting out my doubts
Always caught up in some cloud
Thanks for sitting out my doubts
Blind to all worthwhile routes
Thanks for sitting out my doubts

With wise words such fears you’ve plowed
Thanks for sitting out my doubts
Funny how things fast turn south
Thanks for sitting out my doubts 
I think I feel better now
Thanks for sitting out my doubts
Lucky to have you around
Thanks for sitting out my doubts
