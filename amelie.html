I want to be cryogenically frozen holding my best Amelie smile
And with one of my hands held out two inches in front of my face 
So I can stare at the sparkling lines for eternity, 
or possibly just for a little while

I’m stationary. On my butt. But my hair is windswept like I’m in a fast car.

When I am mobile I am a thermal catastrophe 
By the time I feel the radiator it’s already too late
My fingers have fallen off
Rolled across the floor 
like chef boyardee
They follow me home
And find a way into my pantry
I mistake them for veggie dogs
Chop them into slices
That’s how I eat them with beans
