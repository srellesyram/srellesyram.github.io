A blade of grass, tear it in half
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

From one to two, snip and snap
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Line them all up, from knee to calf
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Tickle your lips, then gnaw and gnash
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Let loogie loose, time drip then splat
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Spit at a bug, give it a bath
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Then use the grass, make it a raft
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

It swings and sways, atop the mast
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Whistle for wind, help it fly fast
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Wave to the captain, free at last
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Watch the sun set, become Earthâ€™s hat
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Feel the time pulse, as air turns black
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Ears pointed out, tuned like a bat
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Hear the birds sing, give them a clap
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Stomp on the ground, choreograph
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Draw with your toes, you spirograph 
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Think side to side, meow like a cat
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Spring up and out, detach from mass
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Fall down to Earth, lie on your back
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Ear to the ground, listen then pat
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Palm upon halm, make ratatat
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Conjure up words, think to abstract
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Oh how brightly, a wish may flash
Look up at the sky, belly laugh

Oh how tender, a blade of grass
Look up at the sky, belly laugh
