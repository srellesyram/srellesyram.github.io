<p>
The day the wasps flew in--they flew in to die. 
It was way too cold outside. We cried and cried and cried. 
My toes fell off and my teeth fell out as I wrapped their bodies in basil. 
One hundred wasps in one hundred leaves they never once stung me and they always said please. 
This is to their buzzing family. Youâ€™re always home with me.
