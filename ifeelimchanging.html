I cannot tell
iF I’ve been many people throughout my life, or whether
I’vE just been one person,
forEver since birth. I think I felt most 
myseLf
when I was ten years old, and
least Myself when I was seventeen.
when I Call out loud, an old name of mine,
I never Hear it. or I choose not to listen.
when I flAsh a glance of mirrored naked eye I do think I choose not to look into its pupil.
when I traNslate old entries I have trouble remembering since
in relivingG, I feel nails puncture my feet.
old handwritIng may as well be new, same could be said for
some old frieNds. I think I mostly
hope to once aGain find myself swimming in a new big truth.
