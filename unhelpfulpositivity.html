Unhelpful positivity 
 
Spreads its

Sunshine dew drops

But not for this egg
No help for this egg
Whose shell has been hardened by the sun

Thickened layer by layer by the 
Huge 
Relentless 
Beating 
Sun

From which some source their power
From which most suffer its gaze


Beautiful shell

Brown marble spotted constellations
Painted with raw umber and burnt sienna

Beautiful shell
Hardened shell
Strong shell

Egg with your beautiful skin
Your hardened face
Jaded expression
Your strong head

Sometimes when the sun sets
I glimpse you
Glowing gold


Yolk circle shines gold inside your walls
Yolk circle tickles your shell from the inside
Yolk circle mixed with white

Yolk mixed with white
Yolk surrounded in white
Yolk lost in white
Yolk trapped in white

Yolk that yearns to free itself
Yolk that yearns to shine like the dew drops
Yolk that fears being dropped in flour and used in a giant’s angel food cake
Yolk that fears boiling under the sun


It’s too much to ask of you
To break your shell with me
For the sun has the potential to fry your soul

I see now how I retrieve my positivity from the sun
And how this positivity cannot permeate the very shell it’s thickened
And how it might hurt the contents within


Perhaps it is the moon you should turn to
And perhaps we should look to the ground

For some 
Rocks

To help you
Crack open


I know I can’t be with you when it happens

For it must be at night
Under the moon
Surrounded by constellations

But for now all I should do is
Look for rocks with you
If you’d like
