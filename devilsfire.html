I crawled out of the devil's fire
after roasting for a good half an hour.

He had said some words before he set me ablaze,
I didn't catch what--I was stuck in a daze

thinking of whether or not I had lived my life
beneath a veil, without insight,

and of what I could have done to have been more true
with myself, and to you.
