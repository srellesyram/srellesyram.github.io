<pre>

FIRST: Record and remember the space as sensory memory.

	1. Count the number of steps you take to walk from your room to the front door.
		a. Do this with all the most common paths taken within the house, 
			i. Such as to/from: 
				1. The kitchen
				2. The living room
				3. The bathroom
				4. Your room
	2. Remember these numbers by heart
	3. Walk these walks with closed eyes 
		i. Until you know can smoothly navigate without bumping into anything
		a. This will make it easier for you to find the house in your dreams


SECOND: Leave your greatest memories within the walls.

	1. Spend some time to recollect the happiest or most significant moments you experienced inside/around the house.
		a. Think of them within categories of the locations in which they took place.
		b. This and the following steps can be performed with loved ones or alone.
	2. Make a list of locations within the house you would like to honor with your memories.
		a. You don’t have to remember everything. Keep your list between the numbers 3 and 10.
	3. Record each memory on a piece of paper no larger than 4x4 inches
		a. Alternatively: collect one object per memory
			i. These are small objects that feel special and can easily be hidden/disguised 
			ii. These can be things you find on the street or between your floorboards
			iii. These can be things you’ve bought either collectively or individually
			iv. Consider these as representations of the memories
			v. Consider these as gifts to give the house as a parting thank you
	4. Create and plan an order in which to visit these locations.
		a. This can be chronological in terms of when such memories occurred, or where each is located spatially.
	5. Memorize the path created from location to location in the order you’ve decided.
		a. Memorize how to navigate 
			i. With your eyes closed, of course
	6. Within the last week in the house, walk the path. 
	7. Visit each location one by one
		a. In the order you’ve decided
		b. With the written memories and/or selected objects in hand.	
		c. When walking between locations, do so with your eyes open. 
	8. Upon reaching each location, recollect the memory
	9. After an appropriate amount of time, find a place within the location to hide your paper or object.
		b. Examples of hidden places: 
			i. stuffed within a crack in the walls
			ii. within an inactive fireplace
			iii. inside a light fixture
			iv. behind a vent
			v. taped under a shelf or cupboard
			vi. under/between the floorboards
		c. Consider bringing along a screwdriver
	7. Avoid telling any future residents where these memories reside.
	
	
THIRD: Take photos.
	1. As simple as that.


FORTH: Leave a mark.
	1. Take a sharp tool, and carve a mark into a permanent surface
		a. Do this either in:
			i. The attic
			ii. The basement
			iii. The closest place you can find to an attic or a basement. 
		b. This can say or be of anything.
		c. Don’t make it too large.
		d. Consider how you can place it in the oddest place possible. 
			i. For example:
				1. On the ceiling
				2. In the corner within a door frame
				3. Behind wallpaper
				4. Upon entrance of a crawl space
		e. Consider how it would feel if someone you nourished left a mark upon you. 
			i. Allow this thought to influence the mark you make.
	2. Make sure to thank the house after you leave your mark.


LAST: Thank the house.
	1. However you feel fit.
		a. For example: Give it a hug, write it a prayer, sing it a song within its walls, etc.


NOTE:
If you find such or similar evidences of previous residents having existed in a space you reside in: 
	1. Spend time with what you found
		a. If applicable:
			i. Appreciate its existence
			ii. Share it with others 
			iii. Celebrate these memories you did not experienced but that were shared with you 
	2. Make sure to put it back where it was hidden
		a. Or hide it in an alternate location nearby
